    "text": "How Hymns Were Chosen\nThe committee has sought hymns well suited for congregational singing and ==examined each one for scriptural and doctrinal soundness.== They prized music that would be attractive both to old and young worshipers, and texts that recognized the diversity of cultures among the English-speaking church members who will use the hymnal. They mined the treasures of Christian hymnody past and present. They selected favorites from our Adventist heritage and gospel songs both old and new. They sought ==hymns that affirm the distinctive beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists== as well as ==those that express points of faith we hold in common with other Christian bodies.==\nThe selection process did not rely, however, on the tastes of the committee members only. Hundreds of pastors and laypersons sent suggestions to the committee. More than three thousand ministers in North America and Australia were asked to rate each hymn in the 1941 Church Hymnal according to whether they would retain or delete it. In response, the committee retained widely used hymns along with those that bore important spiritual messages or enjoyed hallowed associations. ==In order to make room for hymns of greater merit and beauty, they omitted some of marginal poetic or musical value.== The international character of the Seventh-day Adventist Church dictated that patriotic hymns tied to a single nation be passed over. Hymns well adapted to congregational singing were given precedence over compositions intended for choirs or soloists.\nNew hymns were drawn from many sources. ==Hymnals old and new provided texts and tunes of enduring value from other churches. Sometimes it was necessary to alter the text of these hymns to eliminate theological aberrations or awkward, jarring expressions.== With great caution, the text committee replaced archaic and exclusive language whenever this could be done without disturbing familiar phrases, straining fond attachments, or doing violence to historical appropriateness.\nMusically the hymnal was improved with the addition of a number of American folk hymns and Negro spirituals as well as German chorales and old psaltery tunes. The hymnal includes a few modern gospel songs along with several striking new works by Adventist authors and composers."

    "section": "How to Use the Hymnal",
    "text": "How to Use the Hymnal\nA survey of a typical hymnal page will aid the worshiper in the use of the hymnal. The title is the first line of the hymn-poem, except for those gospel songs in which a phrase from elsewhere in the text is more familiar. Both first line and familiar title are listed in the alphabetical index. To the left is found a Bible reference if the hymn is based on a specific passage. Below that appear the author’s name, the date the hymn was written, and the author’s birth and death dates. Occasionally the source of the text is given instead of the author.\nOn the right is the name of the hymn tune if it has a name. Next on the right of the page is a set of numbers indicating the metrical pattern of the poem, which is simply the number of syllables in each line (such as LM for long meter, or 8.8.8.8.). By referring to the Metrical Index one can find other tunes in the same meter that might fit the text and add interest to the singing. Where the same tune is actually printed with different texts elsewhere in the hymnal, the tune is sometimes written in a different key or with a different harmonization, and a cross-reference is noted at the bottom of the page. Cross-references are also used to suggest alternative tunes that are especially well adapted to a particular text. Just above the musical staff on the right of the page is the known information about the composer or source of the music.\nSometimes the word unison is printed above the staff to indicate music that is best interpreted if all sing the melody together. Of course, hymns written in four-part harmony can be sung in unison whenever desired. ==Nevertheless, to make unison singing more enjoyable for all, the pitch of many familiar hymns has been lowered.==\nTo the left, below the music, is the copyright information if the hymn is still protected by copyright. This means the publisher has the right to print the hymn in this book only. For any other use of the hymn one must secure permission from the owner of the copyright. Any errors or omissions in the printing of copyright information will gladly be corrected in future printings. Throughout the hymnal, gospel songs and great hymns stand together in topical clusters. The worship aids in the back of the hymnal offer readings, calls to worship, words of assurance, offertory sentences, and benedictions, all drawn from the words of Scripture. The hymnal includes suggestions for using these worship aids, and congregations will enjoy exploring new applications of their own.\nIn addition to the standard indexes, the “finding aids” include a list entitled Hymns Suitable for Young Worshipers, a canonically arranged index of scriptural allusions in hymns (with special thanks to Edward E. White), a scripture index to the worship aids, and an extensive topical index."

    "text": "Purpose of the Hymnal\nEllen White, cofounder and spiritual leader of our church, noted that “the soul may ascend nearer heaven on the wings of praise.” - Steps to Christ, p. 104. “Singing,” she said, “. . . is as much an act of worship as is prayer.” - Patriarchs of Prophets, p. 594. This hymnal is designed to help Seventh-day Adventists continue this chorus of praise that cheered God’s ancient people, encouraged the early church, powered the Reformation, and brightens the fellowship of those who share the “blessed hope.”"
